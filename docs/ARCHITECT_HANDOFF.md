# AngleMotion — Architect Handoff Brief

**Audience:** the incoming senior developer / technical architect who will own architecture,
maintain V1 discipline, write the Claude Code prompts, pick model/effort, and review output.
**Purpose:** everything needed to make correct decisions and understand 100% of the work done so far.
**Repo root:** `coach-lab/` (Next.js app). **Prod:** https://anglemotion.com
**Phase:** V1 **stabilization** (bug fixes only — see §6). Last updated 2026‑07‑17.

## 1. Product in one paragraph

AngleMotion (internal codename CoachLab) is a **browser-based tennis/sports video-analysis
platform** for coaches. A coach loads a video (file, YouTube, or embed), and the app overlays a
**live pose skeleton**, **biomechanical measurements** (joint angles, hip–shoulder differential,
foot direction), a **Precision AI Track** (a frame-exact baked skeleton that plays perfectly at any
speed), **StroMotion** (Dartfish-style stroboscopic multi-exposure with AI background removal), a
full **drawing/annotation** toolset, **A/B split-screen**, **screen recording with webcam PiP**, and
**export** to MP4 / Google Drive / YouTube. Billing is Stripe (3 tiers + a free 1-hour trial).
Everything is **AI-first but 100% manually editable** — the coach can always override the AI.

## 2. Tech stack, infra, deploy

- **Framework:** Next.js 15.5 (App Router) + React 18 + TypeScript. Tailwind. Deployed on **Vercel**.
- **Auth/DB:** Supabase (`@supabase/ssr`), Postgres + RLS. **Billing:** Stripe.
- **Pose/vision (all in-browser):**
  - MoveNet (Thunder/Lightning) via TensorFlow.js in a **Web Worker** (`lib/poseWorker.ts`) — the live skeleton.
  - MediaPipe Pose Landmarker FULL/HEAVY (`lib/mediapipePose.ts`) — the offline Precision Track + AI-Detect feet (33 landmarks incl. real toe/heel).
  - MediaPipe Interactive Segmenter "MagicTouch" (`lib/mediapipeSegmenter.ts`) — StroMotion pose-anchored background removal.
  - COCO-SSD (`lib/racketCocoDetect.ts`) — racket/implement detection. MediaPipe SelfieSegmentation (`lib/webcamSegmentation.ts`) — webcam cutout.
- **Video/record:** `MediaRecorder` + `captureStream`, `requestVideoFrameCallback`, ffmpeg.wasm (`lib/ffmpegWebmToMp4.ts`) for retime/convert.
- **Self-hosted model assets** under `public/` (`models/`, `tfjs-wasm/`, `mediapipe-wasm/`) — no third-party CDN a network policy could block.
- **No test runner configured** (`scripts`: dev/build/start/lint only). "Verification" = `npx tsc --noEmit` (0 errors) + `npm run build` (0 errors) + **user runtime check** (the app is auth-gated, so an assistant cannot reach `/analysis`).

**Deploy workflow (critical — see `docs/project…`/memory):**
`git commit` → `git push origin snapshot-v1` → `git checkout main && git merge --ff-only snapshot-v1 && git push origin main` → Vercel auto-builds `main`.
- **`snapshot-v1`** = working branch. **`main`** = production (Vercel).
- **ALWAYS `git status` clean before deploy.** A local build passes on the *working tree*; Vercel builds the *commit*. An uncommitted file once passed locally and broke Vercel (commit `45fb07c` → fixed by `797a55d`).
- Vercel poll: `GET /v6/deployments` (TEAM `team_kxyFmQpjcaw08gqg0Z3BOqMx`, PRJ `prj_AdLwIrHDS8HGG7JUG8VtjSUv8Ve2`). Parse JSON with `strict=False` (commit messages contain raw newlines).
- **Tokens live in `coach-lab/.env.local` (gitignored):** `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Never commit them.
- **Supabase migrations:** `scripts/db-apply-sql.sh supabase/migrations/<file>.sql` (Management API, no CLI needed). Project ref `kgifsczgikzgeayueede`.
- **Second Vercel project** `anglemotionverification.vercel.app` on a pinned `google-verification` branch exposes Drive/YouTube behind env-gated flags (`lib/featureFlags.ts`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_VERIFICATION_DEMO=1`) for Google OAuth verification — prod is byte-identical with the flag off. See `GOOGLE_VERIFICATION_DEMO.md`.

`app/analysis/page.tsx` and `components/Canvas.tsx` are **~7.5k-line hot files** — treat every change to them surgically.

## 4. Subsystem architecture (the ones that matter for V1)

**Pose / Skeleton.** Live path = MoveNet in `poseWorker` via `poseWorkerBridge` (single-in-flight). Canvas
render loop (rAF) picks the displayed pose: baked track (`lookupBakedPose(currentTime)`) if a Precision
Track covers the time, else live keypoints, with a wall-clock display interpolation blend. Visibility is
gated by many flags (see the Skeleton RCA in §7 — this is the next architectural target).

**Precision AI Track ("bake").** `page.tsx runPrecisionPass` frame-steps the video, runs MediaPipe FULL/HEAVY
per frame (`mediapipePose.detectPosePrecise`, with test-time augmentation at higher quality), smooths offline
(`trackSmoothing`), stores a video-time-indexed track in `Canvas.bakedTracksRef`. One scope-smart button →
`PrecisionTrackDialog` (speed 0.1×–0.5×, default 0.25×). **This is loved by the user — do not restyle it.**

**StroMotion (FROZEN architecture).** `useStroMotion` owns a `StroMotionDraft` (frames each with
`{selectionBox, sourceFrame, aiSnapshot, working, readyMask, status}`). Auto-Detect: `page.tsx` builds a per-frame
spec set (box + pose scribble), then `useStroMotion.autoProcessFrames` builds every proposal in memory and
commits the **complete set in ONE `setDraft`** (atomic). Masks via `proposeFrameMask` (MagicTouch segmenter →
motion-diff → matte → box-fill fallback). Generate reads the same committed draft (`exportDraft` +
`compositeFromDraft`). Manual path (`selectAreaForFrame` / `finishStroRegionSelect`) unchanged.

**Recording (ACTIVE = `RecordingContext`).** Global getDisplayMedia recorder mounted in `app/layout.tsx`.
`RecordingHub` is the UI. **This is the current bug target — see the Recording RCA in §7.**

**Metrics.** Snapshots + measurement column; AI-Detect angles use `biomechanics/measurements`. Foot line
and the AI number share the one `estimateFootVector` (frozen).

**Auth / Trial / Billing.** Supabase SSR; `middleware.ts` gates `/analysis`+`/academy` by active Stripe sub OR
an unexpired `trials` row (Google sign-in → 1 free hour, one per account, `start_trial()` SECURITY DEFINER).
Prices in `lib/plans.ts` (Light $5/$50, Pro $20/$200, Academy $40/$400).

## 6. V1 Freeze contract (the discipline to enforce)

Full text in **`docs/V1_FREEZE.md`**. Frozen subsystems (no refactor / no API change / no "cleanup" without
explicit approval): **Worker Recovery, Pose Worker Architecture, Foot Line, shared `estimateFootVector`,
Skeleton↔AI-measurement consistency, StroMotion Auto-Detect architecture, Atomic Auto-Detect commit, Manual
StroMotion workflow, Auto-Detect editor workflow, Generate pipeline architecture.**

**Rules (binding):** (1) don't refactor frozen subsystems unless asked; (2) no unrequested quality/architecture
improvements — fix only the reported bug; (3) preserve every existing API unless absolutely required; (4)
smallest possible surface area; (5) never rewrite a working subsystem; (6) **if a fix would touch a frozen
subsystem, STOP and explain before writing code;** (7) preserve backward compatibility with all V1 behavior.
Also protected (CLAUDE.md §6): the analysis-mode ownership model and pose-provenance gating.

## 7. Open stabilization backlog + the two live RCAs

**Remaining (from `docs/V1_FREEZE.md`):** Skeleton Stability · Recording Hub · Phone UI · Timeline Handles ·
Generate Panel · Text tool · Final QA.

### 7a. Recording & Playback RCA (current target — verified)
The active recorder is `RecordingContext` (getDisplayMedia); `ScreenRecorder.tsx` is dead code on `/analysis`.
- **Unresponsive playback:** `RecordingContext.startRecording` runs a **second full-res 2-D compositor on the
  main thread**, driven by **both** a `requestAnimationFrame` loop **and** a `setInterval(paintOnce, 66)` —
  ~75 full-frame `drawImage`/sec for a 30 fps sink (`RecordingContext.tsx:242-276`). The Canvas loop isn't
  de-escalated during recording (`isRecordingRef` is write-only). Transport handlers contend on the main thread.
- **Secondary:** `WebcamSegmenter` runs MediaPipe selfie segmentation **synchronously on the main thread** +
  blur double-draw per frame when cutout is on (`webcamSegmentation.ts:92-128`).
- **Two webcam layers:** the getDisplayMedia capture already contains the on-screen canvas PiP (the *correct*,
  cutout-aware one, `Canvas.tsx:4629-4642`); `RecordingContext.paintOnce` then **unconditionally stamps a
  second raw PiP** (`:254-262`). Duplicate is created **at recording-time compositing** (not preview/export).
- **Smallest fix:** delete the recorder's `recCanvas` compositor and **record the getDisplayMedia video track
  directly** (+ the already-assembled audio tracks). One change removes both the duplicate PiP **and** the
  second main-thread paint pipeline. Fallback if a compositor must stay: rAF-only, ≤30 fps, downscale,
  OffscreenCanvas worker. Second-order (only if cutout still lags): move `WebcamSegmenter` to a Worker.
  **Clear of all frozen subsystems** — do NOT route through `recordReplayToMp4` / `exportStroMotionVideo` (frozen).

### 7b. Skeleton subsystem RCA (next architectural target — no single source of truth)
Visibility is the AND of ~6 flags split across page + Canvas (`skeletonOn`, `stroShowSkeleton`, derived
`skeletonEnabled`, `skeletonEnabledRef`/`skeletonDrawEnabledRef`, internal `skeletonSuppressedRef`,
`hiddenByTrackScope`, data-availability). Causes: **disappearance** = internal suppression the toolbar can't see
(`redo` still sets `skeletonSuppressedRef=true`, `Canvas.tsx:2602` — same class as the fixed undo bug) +
`hiddenByTrackScope` hiding the live skeleton outside baked ranges. **Freeze/impossible-positions** = the display
interpolation blends `posePrev→poseLatest` and those samples are never reset on seek → it slides through
impossible intermediate poses. **Isolated fixes:** remove `redo` suppression; reset interp samples on seek.
**Architectural fix:** one owned visibility intent; render hides only for (a) intent off, (b) no pose. The
`hiddenByTrackScope` policy borders AI-Track — get sign-off before changing it.

*(Text tool, phone Generate panel, timeline handle grab, phone toolbar expand remain scoped but un-diagnosed.)*

## 8. How to drive Claude Code on this repo (for the architect)

- **Diagnosis-first (CLAUDE.md §4).** For any bug, have Claude **read + trace the real path and present the
  root cause before writing code.** The best results here came from "map the architecture, cite file:line,
  rank root causes, propose the smallest fix — no code yet," then approve, then implement.
- **Model / effort:**
  - **Opus + high/max effort** for the 7.5k-line hot files, cross-file architecture, and any pose/render/recording
    work. These files punish shallow reasoning.
  - **Multi-agent workflows ("ultracode")** for read-only *investigations* across many files (the Skeleton and
    Recording RCAs were done this way: parallel tracers → adversarial verify → synthesize). Token-heavy; use for
    genuine architecture questions, not small edits.
  - **Sonnet / lower effort** for isolated, well-scoped edits (copy changes, single-function fixes, config).
- **Always demand:** `tsc` + `npm run build` clean, and `git status` clean before any deploy. Claude self-verifies these.
- **Enforce the freeze:** every prompt should name the target subsystem and say "V1 freeze applies; if a fix needs
  a frozen subsystem, stop and explain first." Claude honors this.
- **Prompt shape that works:** (1) name the subsystem + the exact user-visible bug; (2) list frozen subsystems;
  (3) "read the whole pipeline, map ownership, answer these specific questions, cite file:line"; (4) "smallest
  fix, no redesign"; (5) "no code until I approve the plan." Then a separate "implement ONLY X" prompt.
- **Verification reality:** Claude cannot reach `/analysis` (auth-gated) — runtime behavior is confirmed by the
  coach. So Claude's job is: correct diagnosis + type/build-clean change + a precise manual repro to test.

## 9. Existing docs to read (in the repo)

- `docs/V1_FREEZE.md` — the freeze contract (frozen list + rules). **Start here.**
- `CLAUDE.md` — the working agreement (git policy, diagnosis protocol, protected invariants).
- `DECISIONS.md` — ADRs (e.g. ADR-013 toolbar/logo/StroMotion flow, ADR-014 testing-round freezes).
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md` — system design + roadmap.
- `docs/COACHLAB_V1_SPEC.md`, `docs/COACHLAB_V1_PRODUCT_FREEZE.md` — product spec + product freeze.
- `docs/RESEARCH_pose_precision.md`, `docs/RESEARCH_stromotion_segmentation.md` — the research behind the AI work.
- `GOOGLE_VERIFICATION_DEMO.md` — the OAuth-verification deployment.

**Recommended reading order for the architect:** this file → `docs/V1_FREEZE.md` → `CLAUDE.md` →
`DECISIONS.md` → skim `app/analysis/page.tsx` + `components/Canvas.tsx` headers → the two RCAs in §7.

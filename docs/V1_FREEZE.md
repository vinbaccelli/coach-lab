# AngleMotion V1 Freeze

This document is the contract for the V1 stabilization phase. It lists the
subsystems that are **frozen** (working, verified, and off-limits to refactor)
and the work that **remains**. Every subsystem finished during stabilization is
added here.

Last updated: 2026-07-19

## Rules (binding for every change until V1 ships)

1. **Do not refactor any frozen subsystem** unless explicitly asked.
2. **Do not improve code quality or architecture outside the requested bug.**
3. **Preserve every existing API** unless absolutely required.
4. **Smallest possible surface area** for every change.
5. **Never rewrite a subsystem that already works.**
6. **If a requested fix would require changing a frozen subsystem, STOP and
   explain why before writing code.**
7. **Every fix must preserve backward compatibility** with all existing V1
   behavior.

The goal is stabilization only, not redesign.

## Frozen ✅

| Subsystem | Where it lives | Frozen at |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| ✅ Worker Recovery | `lib/poseWorker.ts` (per-inference timeout, context-loss detection, bounded backoff + WASM fallback) | `9cff403` |
| ✅ Pose Worker Architecture | `lib/poseWorker.ts`, `lib/poseWorkerBridge.ts` (single-in-flight bridge, result routing) | `9cff403` |
| ✅ Foot Line | `components/Canvas.tsx` foot-line render (real toe → ankle→toe, else `estimateFootVector`) | `9cff403` |
| ✅ Shared `estimateFootVector` | `lib/biomechanics/measurements.ts` (single canonical algorithm) | `9cff403` |
| ✅ Skeleton ↔ AI Measurement consistency | Canvas foot line + `computeFootDirection` share geometry + data source | `9cff403` |
| ✅ StroMotion Auto Detect architecture | `app/analysis/page.tsx` (`autoSelectAllObjectFrames`, `buildPlayerFrameSpec`) | `9cff403` |
| ✅ Atomic Auto Detect commit | `hooks/useStroMotion.ts` `autoProcessFrames` (build-all → single `setDraft`) | `9cff403` |
| ✅ Manual StroMotion workflow | `hooks/useStroMotion.ts` `selectAreaForFrame`, `finishStroRegionSelect` | `9cff403` |
| ✅ Auto Detect editor workflow | `FrameMaskEditor` gate + committed frame `{sourceFrame, selectionBox, aiSnapshot, working, readyMask, status:'ready'}` | `9cff403` |
| ✅ Generate pipeline architecture | `lib/stroMotionDraft/exportDraft.ts`, `compositeFromDraft.ts`, `frameMask.ts` (reads the committed draft) | `9cff403` |
| ✅ Recording PiP subsystem | `contexts/RecordingContext.tsx`, `lib/pipRecorderSurface.ts`, `components/Canvas.tsx` webcam-PiP block (Source A suppression) | `2026-07-19`¹ |
| ✅ Skeleton persistent on/off gate (Family B) | `app/analysis/page.tsx` (`skeletonEnabled` formula, StroMotion checkbox → `setSkeletonOn` mirror, `resetMetrics()`, `handleMarkupClear()`) | `2026-07-19`² |

**Frozen means:** no refactor, no API change, no "cleanup". Bug fixes touching
these require explicit approval (Rule 6).

¹ No git repo is present in this working tree (`git rev-parse` fails), so this
row cites the confirmation date instead of a commit hash, unlike the rows above.

² Cites the confirmation date, not a commit hash — as of writing this fix is
**uncommitted** in the working tree (verify with `git status` before assuming
it has landed anywhere beyond the local checkout).

### Recording PiP subsystem — confirmed behavior

Verified end-to-end via live instrumentation + manual test on a real localhost
session (no stale build, no service-worker contamination):

- Meet-style floating camera + Pause/Resume/Stop + live timer, Document PiP,
  survives tab/app switching (PiP window's own rAF drives the paint loop, not
  throttled while the opener tab is hidden).
- Entire-Screen share mode produces exactly ONE webcam in the output: the
  on-canvas webcam (Source A) is suppressed while recording, and the composited
  stamp (Source B) is skipped when `displaySurface === 'monitor'` — the floating
  PiP window itself is the only camera the screen grab picks up.
- Camera re-enable after closing the PiP mid-recording: the Recording Hub's
  webcam toggle button syncs to "off" the moment the PiP closes
  (`onWebcamClosedByPip`), and toggling it back on both feeds the live stream
  into the active recording (`updateWebcamStream`) and re-opens a fresh PiP
  window from that click's gesture (`reopenPipWindow`) — verified through a full
  close → toggle-on → reopen cycle with no freeze and no recording gap.
- Recording continuity is sacred throughout all of the above: `captureStream`,
  `MediaRecorder`, and audio-track assembly are untouched by any of this — PiP
  open/close/reopen only changes what the Source B region draws from.

### Recording PiP subsystem — NOT yet tested

Do not assume these are covered by the verification above:

- **This-Tab / This-Window share modes** — only Entire-Screen has been verified.
  The Source A/B suppression logic is `displaySurface`-gated, so behavior in
  these modes is unconfirmed, not merely unverified-but-assumed-fine.
- **An isolated 60+ second hidden-tab throttle test with the PiP left closed the
  whole time** — the accepted-degradation fallback path (opener `setInterval`
  throttling in a hidden tab) has not been exercised in isolation for a sustained
  duration.
- **PiP window drag/resize as a standalone check** — not verified separately
  from the rest of the recording flow.

### Skeleton persistent on/off gate (Family B) — confirmed behavior

Verified live against running code (not just diff review):

- **B1 (skeleton blanking on StroMotion exit):** turned the skeleton on via the
  canonical toolbar toggle, entered StroMotion, exited fully back to top level,
  re-checked state via the button's `data-active` attribute — held `true`
  throughout. **CONFIRMED FIXED.**
- **B2 (Clear-All silently disabling the skeleton):** with the skeleton on,
  pressed Clear All (`handleMarkupClear`) — state held `true` after, no
  confirmation dialog interfered. **CONFIRMED FIXED.**
- **Canonical toolbar toggle:** confirmed still functions correctly, unchanged
  code path, exercised repeatedly during testing.

Scope of the fix (4 hunks, `app/analysis/page.tsx` only):
- `skeletonEnabled` simplified from `skeletonOn || (stroMotionActive && stroShowSkeleton)`
  to `skeletonOn` — one persistent flag, no longer collapses when StroMotion exits.
- StroMotion-internal checkbox's `onShowSkeletonChange` now also calls
  `setSkeletonOn`, in addition to the existing `setStroShowSkeleton` (which still
  independently gates the StroMotion ghost-pose composite render in
  `Canvas.tsx` — untouched, kept as its own concern per explicit decision).
- `resetMetrics()` no longer calls `setSkeletonOn(false)`.
- `handleMarkupClear()` (Clear-All) no longer calls `setSkeletonOverlayPaused(true)`.

### Skeleton persistent on/off gate (Family B) — NOT yet tested

- **StroMotion-internal checkbox's symmetric wiring** — the two-line change
  where checking/unchecking the checkbox inside StroMotion's frame-review step
  also flips `setSkeletonOn` has not been exercised live. That step is gated
  behind "Upload video first," and no test video was available this session.
  Lower risk than B1/B2 (it rides on already-verified gate logic), but unwatched.

## Remaining ⬜

| Area | Notes |
|------|-------|
| ⬜ Skeleton Stability — Family A | Live-path jitter/jump on slow devices (interpolation clamp, backpressure) — distinct from the (frozen) worker-recovery freeze and now also distinct from the frozen Family B on/off gate above |
| ⬜ Recording Hub | Post-record crop/trim; permission-prompt latency (movable/resizable webcam overlay is now the frozen Recording PiP subsystem above) |
| ⬜ Phone UI | Extended toolbar on phone; general mobile layout |
| ⬜ Timeline Handles | Grab reliability after scrubbing (esp. right handle) |
| ⬜ Generate Panel | Layout overlap on phone |
| ⬜ Text tool | Placement/commit interaction (does not open / commits empty) |
| ⬜ Undo/Skeleton | (fix shipped — re-confirm in QA) |
| ⬜ Final QA | End-to-end pass across desktop + phone before V1 ship |

## Change protocol

For any requested fix:
1. Identify whether it touches a frozen subsystem.
2. If **yes** → stop, explain the conflict, get approval (Rule 6).
3. If **no** → apply the smallest change that fixes the reported bug (Rules 2, 4).
4. `tsc` + build clean; verify; then this log is updated when a subsystem is
   completed/frozen.
